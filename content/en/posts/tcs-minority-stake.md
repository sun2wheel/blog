Switzerland's largest mobility club is partnering with sun2wheel and acquiring a 20% stake in the company. Through this collaboration, TCS aims to further strengthen its commitment to electric mobility and be at the forefront of developing bidirectional charging and storage solutions with Switzerland's market leader in this sector.

Today, Switzerland burns approximately 5 million tons of fossil fuels annually. By 2035, the demand for energy in mobility will largely shift to electricity – thanks to the increasing electrification of road transport. According to Swiss eMobility estimates, the share of plug-in vehicles among new cars will be between 40% and 60% in 2025, and between 91% and 99% by 2035.

In addition to offering conventional unidirectional charging stations, TCS wants to leverage a forward-looking potential of electric mobility through its minority stake in sun2wheel. Bidirectional charging stations can optimize costs by using vehicles as storage instead of a home-installed battery, thereby optimizing self-consumption from a photovoltaic system.

> "sun2wheel enables intelligent control of charging stations with their innovative technology. We see great potential particularly in the bidirectional area."
> — Bernhard Bieri, Director Club TCS

> "TCS has been supporting its members with electric mobility for several years and is therefore the ideal partner for the novel bidirectional charging technology."
> — Marco Piffaretti, Founder and Chairman of the Board at sun2wheel
