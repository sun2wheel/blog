The Swiss Federal Office of Energy (SFOE) awards the seal of quality for energy excellence. Companies that develop energy technologies of the future, bring innovations to market, set new standards for practical solutions, and combine comfort, aesthetics and economic efficiency are recognized.

We were honored to receive the award in the renewable energy category together with our sister company EVTEC. The event at Kursaal Bern took place on January 12, 2023, for the 16th time. Benoît Revaz, Director of SFOE, opened the ceremony with an insightful presentation on the energy turbulence of recent months. Marianne Zünd, Head of Media and Policy, led the evening and presented the coveted award in five different categories.

Afterwards, hundreds of representatives from the Swiss energy scene from politics, business, and research were able to network, discuss technical matters, and make new contacts during an extensive reception.

A successful event – creating value and showing appreciation. We are proud!
