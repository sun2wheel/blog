The national roadmap for electromobility in Switzerland is the new, large-scale guideline for building a comprehensive charging infrastructure by 2025.

sun2wheel was present at the launch of the initiative and is actively involved in advancing Swiss electromobility. The roadmap unites over 60 companies, associations, and public bodies with the common goal of promoting electromobility in Switzerland.

## Goals of the Roadmap

- Building a comprehensive charging network
- Simplifying the installation of charging stations in multi-family buildings
- Promoting bidirectional charging
- Standardization and interoperability

As a pioneer in bidirectional charging, sun2wheel is committed to ensuring that Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) and Vehicle-to-Home (V2H) technologies are recognized and promoted as an important building block of the energy transition.

Electromobility is more than just an alternative to the internal combustion engine – it is an integral part of the future energy system.
